# Apps for teaching intro stats

These are experimental Shiny apps, designed to accompany the intro stats courses being developed by the OpenIntro team on DataCamp. Nothing here is guaranteed to work (yet) :)

Example of how to run an app from the R console:

```
install.packages("shiny") # install shiny, if necessary
library(shiny)
runGitHub("stats-apps", "datacamp", subdir = "best-fit")
```
